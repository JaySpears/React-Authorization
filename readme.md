# Idk Yet? :sweat_smile:

### Client Code Architecture :computer:
`index.jsx` **->** Root file for the React application. Initializes the Redux store, routes, etc.</br>
`actions`  **->** Actions to be dispatched based on user events. Logging in, creating an account, etc.</br>
`assets`  **->** Global assets required throughout the application. Sass mixins, variables, etc.</br>
`components`  **->** Global components to be reused throughout the application. For example, a container component for responsiveness architecture.</br>
`reducers`  **->** Initial state for the redux store.</br>
`routes`  **->** Routes for the application.</br>
`scenes`  **->** Also known as pages. Scenes are the components to be displayed via routes. For example, the login route will display the login scene, etc.</br>

### Server Code Architecture :lock: :floppy_disk:
`index.js`  **->** Root file for the node server. </br>
`controllers`  **->** Modifies client data before passing onto the model.</br>
`models`  **->** Schema structure for database tables. These models are using Sequelize as an ORM.</br>
`routes`  **->** API endpoints. Authorizing user, logging in, etc.</br>

├── controllers

└── routes
   └── ...
